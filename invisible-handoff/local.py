Invisible Handoff — local runner (no Modal required)
Run: python3 local.py

Modes:
  No API key  — loads sample_data/, prints mock output
  With API key — loads sample_data/, calls real LLM

Config: edit config.yaml (no secrets there)
Secrets: copy .env.example to .env and add your API key
         Add NOTION_API_KEY and NOTION_PARENT_PAGE_ID to .env to auto-create Notion pages
